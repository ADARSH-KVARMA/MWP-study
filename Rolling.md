## 🔧 Rolling Process
- **Definition**: Plastically deforming metal by passing it between rolls.
- **Why it’s important**:
  - Most widely used metalworking process.
  - Allows **high production rates**.
  - Provides **close dimensional control**.
- **Forces involved**:
  - **Compressive stresses** → from squeezing action of rolls.
  - **Surface shear stresses** → from friction between rolls and metal.
  - **Frictional forces** also help pull the metal into the rolls.

## 🌡️ Hot vs. Cold Rolling
- **Hot Rolling**:
  - Used for initial breakdown of ingots into blooms and billets.
  - Further hot rolling produces plate, sheet, rod, bar, pipe, rails, structural shapes.
- **Cold Rolling**:
  - Produces sheet, strip, and foil.
  - Advantages: good surface finish, increased mechanical strength, precise dimensional control.
  - Major industrial importance for thin, high-quality products.

## 📏 Terminology of Rolled Products

| Term | Definition | Typical Dimensions | Notes |
|------|------------|--------------------|-------|
| **Bloom** | First breakdown product of ingot | Cross-sectional area > 230 cm²; width ≈ thickness | Used in steelmaking |
| **Billet** | Further reduction of bloom by hot rolling | Minimum ~40 × 40 mm cross-section | In nonferrous metallurgy, “billet” = any hot-worked ingot or extrusion billet |
| **Slab** | Hot-rolled ingot | Cross-sectional area > 100 cm²; width ≥ 2 × thickness | Used for plate and sheet production |
| **Semifinished products** | Blooms, billets, slabs | Intermediate stage before final rolling | Basis for downstream processes |

This section is clarifying **rolled product classifications** and introducing specialized rolling techniques, based on the surrounding content in *Mechanical Metallurgy*.

## 📏 Differentiation of Rolled Products
- **Plate**:  
  - Thickness **> 6 mm** (though exceptions exist depending on width).  
- **Sheet**:  
  - Thickness **< 6 mm**.  
  - Width **> 600 mm**.  
- **Strip**:  
  - Thickness **< 6 mm**.  
  - Width **≤ 600 mm**.  

👉 These distinctions are practical rather than absolute, since steelmaking terminology varies.

---

## 🌡️ Starting Material
- Rolling usually begins with a **cast ingot** or **electroplated slab**.  
- Alternative: **Powder rolling**.  
  - Metal powder is compacted between rolls into a **“green strip.”**  
  - Then sintered, hot/cold worked, and annealed.  
  - **Advantages**:
    - Eliminates ingot breakdown step → saves capital equipment.  
    - Reduces contamination risks in hot rolling.  
    - Produces sheet with **fine grain size** and minimal preferred orientation.

---

## ⚙️ Objectives of Conventional Rolling
- Main goal: **reduce thickness**.  
- Width change is minimal → reduction in thickness leads to **increase in length**.  

---

## 🔧 Specialized Rolling Processes
- **Rollforming**:
  - A cold-rolling method.  
  - Strip is progressively bent into complex shapes by passing through multiple driven rolls.  
  - Thickness remains nearly unchanged.  
  - Best for long, molded sections (e.g., channels, trim).  

- **Thread Rolling**:
  - A blank is fed between **two grooved die plates**.  
  - Threads are formed by plastic deformation, not cutting.  
  - Produces stronger threads due to work hardening and grain flow.

---

## 🖼️ Visual Concept (simplified)

```
Plate:  > 6 mm thick
Sheet:  < 6 mm thick, width > 600 mm
Strip:  < 6 mm thick, width ≤ 600 mm

Powder Rolling → Green Strip → Sintering → Finished Sheet
Rollforming → Strip bent into shapes (channels, trims)
Thread Rolling → Blank pressed between dies → Threads formed
```

This passage is introducing the **basic structure and classification of rolling mills** within the broader context of rolling operations in *Mechanical Metallurgy*. Let’s break it down:

---

## ⚙️ Rolling Mill Components
- **Rolls** → the working elements that compress and shape the metal.
- **Bearings** → support the rolls and allow smooth rotation under heavy loads.
- **Housing** → rigid frame to contain rolls and bearings, resisting massive forces.
- **Drive system** → applies power to the rolls and controls their speed.

👉 Because rolling forces can reach **many meganewtons (MN)**, mills require:
- Extremely rigid construction.
- Very large motors.
- Careful engineering design → making modern continuous mills **capital-intensive** and requiring skilled labor.

---

## 🏭 Classification of Rolling Mills
Rolling mills are categorized by **number and arrangement of rolls**:

- **Two-high mill (simplest, most common)**:
  - Two rolls of equal size.
  - Rotate in **one direction only**.
  - After each pass, the stock must be returned to the entrance:
    - Either manually carried back.
    - Or lifted on a platform to pass above the rolls.
  - **Limitation**: slower productivity due to reversal handling.

- **Improvement in productivity**:  
  Later designs introduced reversing drives or additional roll arrangements (like three-high or four-high mills) to avoid manual return and increase efficiency.

## 🖼️ Visual Concept (simplified)

```
Two-High Mill:
   [Roll] ↑
   [Roll] ↓
   Stock enters → compressed → must be returned for next pass
```

This section is explaining the **evolution of rolling mill designs** to improve productivity, reduce power requirements, and enable rolling of very thin or strong materials. Let’s break it down clearly:

---

## 🔧 Types of Rolling Mills

1. **Two-High Reversing Mill (Fig. 17-1b)**  
   - Rolls rotate in both directions.  
   - Workpiece can be passed back and forth without manual return.  
   - Improves productivity compared to a simple two-high mill.

2. **Three-High Mill (Fig. 17-1c)**  
   - Upper and lower rolls are driven.  
   - Middle roll rotates by friction.  
   - Workpiece can be passed alternately through upper and middle, then middle and lower rolls → no need to reverse roll direction.

3. **Four-High Mill (Fig. 17-1d)**  
   - Uses **small-diameter work rolls** for reduced power requirements and precise rolling.  
   - Small rolls lack rigidity, so they are supported by **large backup rolls**.  
   - Enables rolling of **very thin sheet** to close tolerances.

4. **Cluster Mill (Fig. 17-1e)**  
   - Each work roll is supported by **two backing rolls**.  
   - Provides extra rigidity for rolling thin sheet.  
   - **Sendzimir Mill**: a modification of the cluster mill, specialized for rolling **thin sheet or foil from high-strength alloys**.

---

## 🏭 Tandem Mills (Fig. 17-2)
- For **high production**, multiple rolling mills are installed in series.  
- Each set of rolls = a **stand**.  
- Each stand takes a different reduction, so strip velocity changes at each stage.  
- **Synchronization**: Roll speeds are carefully controlled so each stand matches the delivery speed of the previous one.  
- This allows continuous, efficient rolling of long strips.

---

## 🖼️ Visual Concept (simplified)

```
Two-High Reversing: Rolls reverse → back-and-forth passes
Three-High: Work alternates between upper/middle/lower rolls
Four-High: Small work rolls + large backup rolls
Cluster/Sendzimir: Work rolls supported by multiple backups → thin, strong sheets
Tandem: Multiple stands in series → synchronized speeds
```

This passage is describing **specialized rolling mill designs** that go beyond conventional two‑high, three‑high, or four‑high mills, focusing on how they achieve reduction and control product quality.

## 🔧 Planetary Mill (Fig. 17‑3)
- **Structure**:  
  - Two heavy **backing rolls**.  
  - Surrounded by many small **planetary rolls**.  
- **Operation**:  
  - A slab is hot reduced directly to strip **in one pass**.  
  - Each planetary roll sweeps a circular path between backing roll and slab, applying a nearly constant reduction.  
  - As one pair of planetary rolls leaves contact, another pair engages, repeating the reduction.  
  - The total reduction = **sum of many small reductions** in rapid succession.  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - Action resembles **forging more than rolling** (successive localized compressions).  
  - Requires **feed rolls** to introduce the slab.  
  - Often uses **planishing rolls** at the exit to improve surface finish.

---

## 🧊 Innovative Cold‑Rolling Designs
1. **Pendulum Mill**  
   - Uses **two small‑diameter work rolls**.  
   - Rolls **reciprocate over the arc of contact**.  
   - Cold reduces a slab into thin sheet.  
   - Provides controlled reduction with small rolls.

2. **Contact‑Bend‑Stretch (CBS) Rolling Process**  
   - Based on a **four‑high mill**.  
   - Incorporates a **small‑diameter floating bend roll**.  
   - Enhances control of sheet bending and stretching during reduction.  
   - Designed to improve uniformity and surface quality in cold‑rolled sheet.

---

## 🖼️ Visual Concept (simplified)

```
Planetary Mill:   [Backing Roll] + [Many Planetary Rolls] → Slab reduced in one pass
Pendulum Mill:    [Two small rolls] reciprocate → Thin sheet
CBS Process:      [Four-high mill] + floating bend roll → Controlled bend/stretch
```

Based on **Chapter 15 (Fundamentals of Metalworking)** and **Chapter 17 (Rolling of Metals)** in the provided text, here is the comparative difference between Hot Rolling and Cold Rolling.

### Comparison of Hot Rolling vs. Cold Rolling

| Feature | Hot Rolling | Cold Rolling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temperature** | Performed above the recrystallization temperature (typically $> 0.6 T_m$). | Performed below the recrystallization temperature (usually at room temperature). |
| **Strain Hardening** | Strain hardening is rapidly eliminated by dynamic recovery and recrystallization; the metal does not retain the hardening. | Strain hardening (work hardening) occurs; strength and hardness increase while ductility decreases with deformation. |
| **Flow Stress & Force** | Flow stress is low and essentially constant. Lower energy and forces are required for deformation. | Flow stress increases with deformation. High rolling forces and power are required. |
| **Microstructure** | Distorted grain structure is replaced by new, equiaxed, strain-free grains. Cast structures (dendrites/porosity) are broken down and refined. | Grains are elongated in the direction of rolling. A strong crystallographic texture (preferred orientation) is developed. |
| **Surface Finish** | Poorer surface finish due to high-temperature oxidation and scale formation. | Superior surface finish. |
| **Dimensional Control** | Tolerances are wider due to thermal expansion/contraction and the presence of scale. | Close dimensional tolerances can be maintained; produces precise gauge thickness. |
| **Friction** | High friction coefficients ($\mu \approx 0.2$ up to sticking). | Low friction coefficients ($\mu \approx 0.05 - 0.10$) with effective lubrication. |
| **Minimum Gauge** | Limited; difficult to roll very thin sections due to heat loss and roll flattening issues. | Capable of producing very thin sheet and foil (especially on cluster/Sendzimir mills). |
| **Typical Applications** | Initial breakdown of ingots into blooms, billets, and slabs; production of rails, structural shapes, and thick plates. | Production of sheet, strip, and foil; finishing operations to achieve specific mechanical properties (tempers). |

Based on **Chapter 17, Section 17-8 (Problems and Defects in Rolled Products)** of the provided text, rolling defects can be categorized into problems concerning dimensional accuracy (gauge), shape (flatness), and structural integrity (cracking).

Here is a detailed explanation of these defects:

### 1. Dimensional and Gauge Defects
These defects arise from the elastic deformation of the rolling mill itself. Because rolling forces are high ($1 \text{ to } 3 \text{ GN m}^{-1}$), the mill is not a rigid body.

*   **Mill Spring:** Under high rolling loads, the rolls flatten and bend, and the housing stretches. Consequently, the **exit thickness** of the sheet is always greater than the roll gap setting under no-load conditions. To control this, the mill's elastic constant must be known and compensated for.
*   **Limiting Gauge (Minimum Thickness):** There is a limit to how thin a sheet can be rolled. As the sheet gets thinner, the resistance to deformation increases. Eventually, the rolls flatten elastically rather than plastically deforming the workpiece. The limiting thickness ($h_{min}$) is proportional to the coefficient of friction ($\mu$), roll radius ($R$), and flow stress of the metal ($\sigma_0'$), as given by the formula:
    $$h_{min} \approx \frac{\mu R \sigma_0'}{12.8}$$
    *(for steel rolls)*

### 2. Shape and Flatness Defects
"Shape" in rolling terminology refers to flatness. Defects here are caused by **roll bending** along their length. If the roll gap is not perfectly parallel, one area of the sheet will be reduced more than another. Since volume is constant, the area with greater reduction must elongate more.

*   **Wavy Edges (Long Edges):**
    *   *Cause:* The rolling force tends to bend the rolls apart at the center. If the rolls deflect, the edges of the sheet are compressed more (thinned more) than the center.
    *   *Result:* The edges elongate more than the center. Because the sheet is a continuous body, the edges are restrained by the center and buckle into waves (Fig. 17-9d).
*   **Center Buckles (Loose Middle):**
    *   *Cause:* This is the opposite of wavy edges. It usually occurs if the rolls have too much **camber** (crown) ground into them to compensate for deflection. The center is thinned and elongated more than the edges.
    *   *Result:* The center fibers buckle because they are longer than the edge fibers.
*   **Zipper Breaks:**
    *   *Cause:* Under certain conditions of differential elongation (center stretching more than edges), the tension in the center may cause cracks along the centerline of the sheet (Fig. 17-9e).

### 3. Cracking and Fracture Defects
These defects typically result from **inhomogeneous deformation** and secondary tensile stresses generated during rolling.

*   **Edge Cracking:**
    *   *Cause 1 (Lateral Spread):* As metal passes through the rolls, friction opposes lateral spread more at the center than at the edges. This uneven spreading puts the edges in tension, leading to cracking (Fig. 17-10b).
    *   *Cause 2 (Inhomogeneous Deformation):*
        *   **Light Reductions:** Only the surface is deformed. The overhanging material is not compressed directly and is forced to elongate by the center, setting up secondary tensile stresses at the edges (Fig. 17-11a).
        *   **Heavy Reductions:** The center expands laterally more than the surface (barreling), creating secondary tensile stresses that crack the edges (Fig. 17-11b).
*   **Center Splitting:**
    *   *Cause:* Extreme cases of the stress distribution found in lateral spread can cause the sheet to split down the center (Fig. 17-10c).
*   **Alligatoring:**
    *   *Description:* The workpiece splits along a horizontal plane at the center, with the upper and lower halves curling outward like an alligator's mouth (Fig. 17-11c).
    *   *Cause:* Secondary tensile stresses along the centerline, often aggravated by metallurgical weakness (like inclusions) or if the sheet curls due to uneven roll speeds.

### 4. Metallurgical and Surface Defects
These originate from the ingot stage or the rolling practice itself.

*   **Laminations:** Caused by internal defects such as pipe, blowholes, or nonmetallic inclusions (stringers) that are flattened during rolling. They drastically reduce strength in the thickness direction.
*   **Surface Defects:**
    *   **Slivers, Seams, and Scabs:** Result from defects on the ingot surface that were not removed by conditioning (grinding or chipping) before rolling.
    *   **Scratches:** Caused by defective rolls or guides.
    *   **Orange Peel:** A surface roughening caused by heavy deformation in sheet metal with a large grain size.
